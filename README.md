# Power-BI-Capstone-Project

**Project Overview**  
A leading e-commerce department store, connecting small businesses across regions to customers through a unified platform. This project leverages anonymized commercial data from ShopNest to build a Power BI dashboard, providing insights into sales, customer behavior, and operational efficiency. The dataset includes 9 interconnected tables: Customers, Geolocation, Order_items, Order_payments, Order_reviews, Orders, Products, Sellers, and Product Categories.

**Objective**  
The goal is to design a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that addresses key business analytics questions, enabling ShopNest to make data-driven decisions. The dashboard visualizes critical metrics such as top-selling categories, delayed orders, payment trends, product ratings, regional sales, seasonal patterns, and revenue trends.

**Features**  
- **Top Categories by Total Price**: Visualizes the top 10 product categories by total sales.  
- **Delayed Orders Analysis**: Shows the number of delayed orders per category (actual delivery date > estimated).  
- **Monthly Delayed vs On-Time Orders**: Compares delayed and on-time orders monthly with drillthrough for detailed analysis.  
- **Payment Method Analysis**: Displays the most used payment methods via a pie chart.  
- **Product Rating Analysis**: Highlights the top 10 highest-rated and bottom 10 lowest-rated products using bar charts.  
- **State-wise Sales Analysis**: Visualizes high and low sales by state for regional performance insights.  
- **Seasonal Sales Patterns**: Identifies quarterly sales trends over the year.  
- **Revenue Analysis**: Tracks total revenue and yearly trends to uncover growth patterns.  

**Deliverables**  
1. **Power BI Dashboard (PBIX File)**: A single-sheet dashboard with all visualizations, slicers, and interactive features.  
2. **Report (DOC File)**: A detailed document with sections for each task, including question statements, visualization screenshots, and insights.  

**Repository Contents**
